# Credit-Risk-Model
Developed a decision tree classification model on the UCI German Credit dataset to predict the likelihood of loan default. The model incorporated financial and demographic factors to classify the response variable. Both in-sample and out-of-sample performance were evaluated using misclassification error, cost-sensitive metrics, and AUC.
